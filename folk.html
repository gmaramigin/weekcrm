        <h3 class="overview__title">What’s that?</h3>
        <p class="overview__text">
          Folk is a people-first CRM built for organizing and managing your network. It centralizes contacts from Gmail, LinkedIn, spreadsheets, and other sources, allowing teams to collaborate around relationships — without needing to build deal pipelines or complex workflows.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="overview__item">
        <h3 class="overview__title">For whom?</h3>
        <p class="overview__text">
          Built for teams in HR, fundraising, recruiting, partnerships, and PR — any group working around people rather than deals. Folk is ideal for startups, agencies, or freelancers managing a network in a collaborative way.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="overview__item">
        <h3 class="overview__title">Strengths</h3>
        <ul class="overview__text">
          <li>Unified contact book: sync from Gmail, LinkedIn, and spreadsheets</li>
          <li>Tags, filters, reminders, and custom fields make sorting easy</li>
          <li>Team inbox and shared contact views to avoid duplicate efforts</li>
          <li>Email campaigns, templates, and tracking built-in</li>
          <li>Modern UI with simple onboarding for non-tech teams</li>
        </ul>

      <div class="overview__item">
        <h3 class="overview__title">What’s worth considering?</h3>
        <ul class="overview__text">
          <li>Not suited for complex sales pipelines or heavy reporting</li>
          <li>Some features (like enriched data or multi-user roles) require a paid plan</li>
          <li>Better for people-centric workflows — not a fit for opportunity tracking</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div class="overview__item">
        <h3 class="overview__title">Conclusion</h3>
        <p class="overview__text">
          If your team still manages outreach in spreadsheets, Folk is a clear upgrade. It’s made to bring structure to contact-heavy work like PR, hiring, and relationship management — without overloading you with sales jargon or pipeline pressure.
