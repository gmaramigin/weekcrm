a:5:{s:5:"title";s:68:"Attio Rolls Out Desktop Version: Faster CRM Access for Focused Work";s:16:"text-format-info";a:3:{s:10:"text-final";s:1108:"<p>Attio has released a desktop version of their CRM app, giving users a faster and more stable way to work with their sales data outside the browser.</p>
<p>The desktop version is available for both macOS and Windows. It mirrors the full web functionality but brings smoother performance and better multitasking — especially valuable for teams spending hours in CRM each day.</p>
<p>For those who prefer to keep essential tools separate from browser clutter or want to reduce distractions, the native desktop app offers a more focused workflow. Users can switch between pipelines, search contacts, and track conversations without worrying about tab overload or accidental refreshes.</p>
<p>This update fits naturally into Attio’s product direction — keeping things fast, lightweight, and customizable for modern go-to-market teams.</p>
<p>For now, the web and mobile apps remain unchanged. But if you rely on Attio daily, it’s worth trying the desktop experience.</p>
